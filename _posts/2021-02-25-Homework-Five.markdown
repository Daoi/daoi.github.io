#### Case Study Choice # 2: Cloudfare Workers Microservices
I'm selecting Cloudfare workers as i've used the service before breifly as part of an application for an internship at Cloudflare and found the tool interesting. While I only used it for a couple of functions to handle some basic web functionality, I think it would be interesting to to investigate what you could do with it on a more complex level. I think it'd be interesting to see how a Microservice could be created from the cloudfare workers platform.
