#### Case Study Choice # 23: Microservice Patterns
I wanted to choose this case study because patterns are essentially general reusable solutions to problems. This seems like a very useful
topic for learning the fundamentals in microservices. By becoming familiar with the comman design patterns involved in using microservices I hopefully will gain a good amount of insight of practical implementations of microservices, issues they might run into, and how they can be used in general. As well as how to solve and think about microservices from a design standpoint, and what goes into creating one.
